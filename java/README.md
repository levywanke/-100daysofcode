## Introduction
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Java is fundamentally object-oriented, which means it uses objects to represent data and methods to manipulate that data. The four main principles of OOP are:

- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or class.
- **Inheritance**: Mechanism by which one class can inherit fields and methods from another class.
- **Polymorphism**: Ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

### 2. Classes and Objects
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a datatype by bundling data and methods that work on the data.
- **Object**: An instance of a class. Objects have states and behaviors.

### 3. Data Types
Java supports various data types including:
- **Primitive Types**: int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean, char
- **Reference Types**: Objects and arrays

### 4. Control Flow Statements
- **Conditional Statements**: if, else if, else, switch
- **Loops**: for, while, do-while
- **Branching Statements**: break, continue, return

### 5. Exception Handling
Java uses exceptions to handle errors and other exceptional events. It provides a robust and flexible mechanism for handling exceptions.
- **try, catch, finally**
- **throw and throws**

### 6. Java Standard Library
Java comes with a large standard library (Java API) that provides many useful classes and methods:
- **java.lang**: Fundamental classes such as String, Math, Integer, System, and Thread.
- **java.util**: Utility classes such as collections framework, legacy collection classes, event model, date and time facilities, and miscellaneous utility classes (e.g., Random, Scanner).
- **java.io**: Input and output classes (e.g., File, InputStream, OutputStream, Reader, Writer).
- **java.net**: Classes for implementing networking applications (e.g., Socket, ServerSocket, URL).

### 7. Multithreading
Java provides built-in support for multithreading. A thread is a lightweight process, and Java provides a rich API for creating and managing threads.
- **Thread class and Runnable interface**
- **Synchronization**
- **Concurrency utilities in java.util.concurrent**

### 8. Collections Framework
The Java Collections Framework provides a set of interfaces and classes to store and manipulate groups of data as a single unit.
- **List, Set, Map, Queue** interfaces
- **ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, TreeMap, PriorityQueue** classes

### 9. Java Development Tools
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: Contains tools needed to develop Java programs, including the Java compiler (javac), JRE, and other utilities.
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Provides libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java.
- **IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)**: Tools like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans enhance productivity with features like code completion, debugging, and version control integration.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. **Download and install JDK**: [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
2. **Set up environment variables**: Add `JAVA_HOME` and update `PATH`.

### Hello World Example
Create a file named `HelloWorld.java`:
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
Compile and run the program:
```sh
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```
