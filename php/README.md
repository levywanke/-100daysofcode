# PHP Language Overview

## Introduction

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular open-source server-side scripting language designed primarily for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP is known for its efficiency in creating dynamic and interactive web pages.

## Key Features

- **Server-Side Scripting**: PHP code is executed on the server, and the result is sent to the client's web browser as plain HTML.
- **Cross-Platform**: PHP runs on various platforms including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Embedded HTML**: PHP can be embedded within HTML code, making it easy to generate dynamic web content.
- **Database Integration**: PHP supports a wide range of databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more.
- **Extensive Library Support**: PHP has a rich set of built-in functions and support for numerous libraries to extend its capabilities.
- **Community and Support**: PHP has a large and active community, offering extensive documentation, tutorials, and support forums.

## Basic Syntax

```php
<?php
// This is a single-line comment
/* This is a 
   multi-line comment */

// Outputting text
echo "Hello, World!";

// Variables
$variable = "PHP";

// Arrays
$array = array("value1", "value2");

// Associative Arrays
$assoc_array = array("key1" => "value1", "key2" => "value2");

// Functions
function greet($name) {
    return "Hello, " . $name;
}

// Conditional Statements
if ($variable == "PHP") {
    echo "This is PHP!";
} else {
    echo "This is not PHP!";
}

// Loops
for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
    echo $i;
}
?>
```

## Database Connection Example (MySQL)

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";
$dbname = "database";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

$sql = "SELECT id, name FROM users";
$result = $conn->query($sql);

if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
    while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
        echo "id: " . $row["id"]. " - Name: " . $row["name"]. "<br>";
    }
} else {
    echo "0 results";
}
$conn->close();
?>
```
